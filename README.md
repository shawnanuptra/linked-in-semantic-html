# Exercise: LinkedIn Post

Recreate the semantic markup of this LinkedIn post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sunderland-software-city_techskills-developers-northeast-activity-7227265331172388865-Ali_/

Work on what's visible down to the comment form (leave out the list of comments below), but put in placeholders for what you can't see.

For example, you should have something on the (at the time of writing) "+95" part of the reactions to open up the modal list, but don't implement the modal itself. Likewise, don't build an entire emoji window off of the comment box, just handle the trigger.

## Getting Started

Clone the whole repository to your computer

```
git clone git@github.com:Sunderland-Software-City/TTP-Semantic-HTML-Practice.git
```

Install the Node dependencies.

```
cd linked-in
npm i
```

Create a new branch for your work, use your screen name as a prefix to help keep things organised. For example:

```
git checkout -b jonspark/linked-in
```

Work on your exercise, commit your changes as you go.

Push your work to GitHub and create a draft PR. When you're ready, request a review (we just won't merge them to `main`!).

## Content

All the images you should need are in `./public/images`. Here is the content so that it can be copy/pasted into your solution.
